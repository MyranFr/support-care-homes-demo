# Support & Care Homes Demo Website

This is a static demo website for a Support and Care Homes facility, designed for easy deployment on GitHub Pages.

## 🚀 How to Deploy on GitHub Pages

1. **Create a New Repository**
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and create a new public repository (e.g., `support-care-homes-demo`).

2. **Upload Site Files**
   - Upload all files and folders from this directory (including `.nojekyll`, `index.html`, `style.css`, etc.) to the root of your new repository.

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**
   - Go to your repository's **Settings** > **Pages**.
   - Under "Source", select the `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder.
   - Click **Save**.

4. **Access Your Site**
   - After a minute, your site will be live at:
     `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/`

## 📝 Customization
- Edit `index.html` and `style.css` to update content, images, or styles.
- Add more pages as needed (e.g., `about.html`, `services.html`).

## 📄 Notes
- The `.nojekyll` file ensures GitHub Pages serves your site as plain static files.
- For forms, this demo uses [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) for static form handling.
